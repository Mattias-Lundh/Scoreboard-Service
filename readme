this is a service that was built by me and my brother, it was used commercially. cool =)

what am i looking at?

there is a program that prints graphics on top of a normal tv feed, this program understands a particular csv format.
you are looking at the service that creates this csv file.

it basically requires 
1. An administrator that approves the use of the system by generating a key 
2. A user that inputs the key into the venue gui, participates on the sports event, and inputs new values as the teams score. 
3. Another dude that sitts anywere he/she likes with the graphics printing program. duties involved here is to start the csv 
app to gain live updates of the game data in the form of a scv file.

system sourcecode kept in private repository, sorry =(
